    <h1>This is my Final Portfolio project.</h1>

    <p>For most of my assignments this semester I just used the same website but built and added the new things I learned each week.</p>

    <a href="HTML Lists.html">Click here to see the main website.</a>

    <a href="Images.html">Click here to see my images assigment.</a>

    <a href="Gradients and Positioning.html">Click here to see my gradients and positioning.</a>

    <a href="Tables and Forms.html">Click here to see my tables and forms assigment.</a>

        <p> This is my reflection paper:    This semester I learned about creating websites with HTML and making them look good with CSS. One of my favorite things about this class is how I can look back
            at all of my projects and see how much I improved. I also really liked using CSS to make my websites look unique. Learning all of the new things about how to add
            effects and little things that make the website function or look better.
        </p>
        <p> Something that I struggled with this semester was getting my GitHub page working because
            I didn't understand everything about it but thankfully Mr. Gross was able to help
            me out. Getting some of the code to work was also hard and it could take a very long time to get it to work properly. Overall, this class was a lot of fun and
            I am excited for the next semester.
